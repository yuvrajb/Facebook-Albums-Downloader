{"name":"Facebook Albums Downloader","tagline":"Download favorite albums of your friends from Facebook!","body":"Facebook Albums Downloader\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nDownload favorite albums of your friends from Facebook!\r\n\r\nWe all are friends with people from all over the world on Facebook. And some of them post amazing  photographs of their journey to some exotic location or of their most memorable moments which you were part of.\r\n\r\nWe all love viewing such photographs again and again and we do download some of them. But the problem arises when we want the complete bank! Unfortunately, Facebook doesn't provide us with an option of downloading an entire album and that's where Facebook Album Downloader will be a handy desktop application.\r\n\r\nThe best part of this desktop application is that we don't have to worry about the albums being stored on third-party servers from where you would eventually download the entire zip file. It's a bit lengthy and time consuming task. This application brings all those photos right to your computer. It's easy and very simple to use.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication\r\n===========\r\n\r\nTo get the desktop app, download the application folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource Code\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThe source code of the entire application, from the scratch, has been made available. It's open source so you can make or suggest changes.\r\nExcept the application folder, all the packages are required to be downloaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\nFirst I'd like to thank the people behind WebLnF which makes this application look more appealing than the one in Nimbus when I first started with this project.\r\nSince it's an open source project, I'd highly appreciate if you will keep my name in-tact in the code and I will also be looking forward to other names who contribute towards this project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
